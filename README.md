# UVAlert
## iOS App that gives you info about the UV radiation based on the weather forecast.

This App is currently **under development** since I'm developing it for learning purposes.

If you want to test the application, you will need to create an accuweather API account, learn more:

To run the application you just need to put your own API key on the ViewController.swift file

`
let apikey = "your_api_key"
`
